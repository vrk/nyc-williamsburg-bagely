# I'm in Williamsburg NYC and I'm feeling bagel-y
sept 2021

---

## ‚ùî what this is

when I lived in san francisco, my friend sent me a google doc she had called "SF: SEE EAT DRINK" with a list of all her recommendations for the city. I found it so helpful and charming, and I always meant to create my own version for nyc.

I've had this idea for years, to make a "vrk recommends" nyc travel guide thing, but nyc is so big that every time I tried to sit down and make it, the whole task felt big and overwhelming and not fun and I'd give up.

so I have a new angle: instead of trying to cover all of nyc, I'm just going to cover specific scenarios. and actually how about just one specific scenario?

with that, here is my guide on what I do when I'm in williamburg and I'm feeling bagel-y, as least as of september 2021.

## ü•Ø feeling bagel-y

when I'm feeling bagely, I don't necessarily need a bagel - I get this feeling like "hmm I could eat a bagel right now" and then there's actually a set of food, broader than a bagel, that can satisfy this craving

a *bagellike*: a food that satisfies my bagel-y craving, even if not a bagel

## cafe beit for a hot bagel with cream cheese

- Cafe Beit is not a bagel shop, nor are bagels a particular specialty.
- But! When I want a simple hot bagel with cream cheese, this is where I turn to.
- I've found that a lot of bagels in NYC when you get them toasted, you end up with the worst of both worlds, like the bagel is kinda dried out now, but it was never warmed up enough to get that melty cream cheese effect
- Cafe Beit always warms the bagel up hot-hot, without toasting to a crisp, so it's just a satisfying bagel

**also good there:**
- flavored lattes! they do house-made syrups & nut milks. I get "ice honey latte with oat milk" routinely

## gertie for the "best bialy" / smoked salmon on bialy
- ok I LOVE this bagellike
- the menu item is called "best biali" and it's smoked salmon pastrami on a biali with onions + dill cream cheese 
- it's just a great combo of flavors
- a v good salmon with perfect amount of cream cheese + pickled onions!! + dill!! such good things and a side pickle if you're lucky
- a frequent specific craving of mine

**also good there:**
- I enjoy their cold brew which comes with _crushed ice_, which I was surprised by how much I preferred to regular ice in a coffee situation

## lion's milk for the "ismir" / feta + tomato on simit

- I stopped in Lion's Milk on the way to work and I asked them if they had bagels, they said they didn't but they had simit sandwiches
- and I got one mostly out of social awkwardness
- but then it was soooo tasty
- very warm, good bread-to-stuff ratio, nice amount of tanginess
- it was immediately added to my mental rotation of bagellikes in williamsburg

## bakeri for a ham & cheese croissant 

- bakeri makes a great ham & cheese croissant - it's small, warm, buttery, just a very delicious pastry
- ‚ú® gotta go in the mornings (let's say... before 10/11am?) or else they sell out 

**also good there:**
- there's some sort of muffin that's got like blueberry and cranberry and lemon I think? anyway it's good!

## partners for a cheddar jalepeno muffin

- Great muffin texture, really soft and buttery
- When I want something that's flavorful but in a light consistent texture

**also good there:**
- I like their fruit cups, they add mint leaves which fancies up the experience
- I believe I've had a confetti? cookie that was surprisingly tasty. like I had bought the cookie in a social situation where it would have been awkward to order nothing, so I was like "uh I guess I'll get this cookie" and then I remember eating it like "oh wow, good cookie"

## not quite bagellikes

if I'm scanning the list of bagellikes and not really feeling inspired, I also ask myself, am I feeling...

...like onigiri?
- Ten Inchi has salmon mayo onigiri
- 3rdfloorbk has tuna mayo onigiri AND spam onigiri, both of which are my favorites, but I actually haven't tried either of them because I was recovering from wisdom teeth survery when I went by here üò≠ so this is on my mental list of like, I should go by and try these onigiris

...like kimbap?
-   Ms Ohho has tuna mayo kimbap that's v good
